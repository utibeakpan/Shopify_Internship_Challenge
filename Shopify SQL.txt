Answer is  Boston Crab Meat and it was ordered 160 times


I used two CTEs to pull in the German orders and then get a second table that has the order ID ,product name of the items in each order and the quantity of items. 
Afterwards, I created the outer query that uses left join to search the second table for only german orders, grouped the result by the product names and calculated the number of times each product was ordered using sum.
